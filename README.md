Hello WORLD!!!!
I am brand new to Software Testing and Quality Assurance.  I am in the process of completing a certificate program.  I have dipped my toe in the water previously and am now looking to jump in with both feet.  I have no prior IT background.  I am a banker by trade for the past 10 years.  I am looking to make a career change for the betterment of my sanity.
